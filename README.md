#  Spec Foresight – Jaime Vela Rodrigo

**An embodied practice of future-making rooted in aesthetic discernment, spiritual integrity, and collective regeneration**

## 1. Personal Orientation

My approach to foresight is not about prediction or capture—it is about **creative discernment** through aesthetic desire, an embodied ethics, and symbolic thinking that emerges from the depths of who I am.  
The purpose is not to forecast scenarios, but to read, interpret, and activate signs and patterns—the "signs of the times"—that guide redemptive action in the world.

> The future is not predicted: it is redeemed.

## 2. Context of Origin

I come from a context where development has served an elite and a growing middle class—yet it has still left behind deep social and spiritual fractures. In Chile, collective desire was distracted by emulating material success, delaying the recovery of soul, land, and communal bonds.  
Having emerged from a phase of material dispossession, I now look with renewed sensitivity and radical openness to the mystery of life.

## 3. Epistemological Framework

My framework stands at the intersection of:

- Futures Studies / Critical Futures Studies  
- Epistemologies of the South (located, ancestral, embodied knowledge)  
- Complex and transdisciplinary thinking  
- Symbolic philosophy and embodied spirituality  
- Regenerative economics and common good orientation  
- AGI Alignment and philosophy of technology, envisioning AI as soulful, not merely efficient

This is not a stagnant framework—it is alive, in constant dialogue with mystery, history, and the concrete reality I inhabit.

## 4. Prayer as Cognitive Praxis

> Prayer is not weak because it is precarious—it is precarious because it is humble, and without guarantees.

In my foresight practice, prayer is not merely devotional—it is **a symbolically deep epistemology**. It does not control, yet it is potent as it trusts. Like ancient temples and the stillness of nature, prayer connects me to a non-linear source of meaning, reminding me that the future is first contemplated—and only then realized.

## 5. The Secular Creator’s Prayer on the Threshold

I ask for no certainties. I open myself—with gratitude and humility—to mystery.  
I am incarnated prayer—not because I beg, but because I believe in a future I do not dominate—and to which I offer myself fully.  
I renounce the illusion of control. I transgress limiting beliefs. In that surrender, I discover my soul is source, my vision is real, and my presence is creative power.

Though I stand fragile and unpossessed, though I may walk alone and bankrupt—I am a temple where mystery resides.  
From this threshold, I create. From this prayer, I act. From this surrender, I redeem promise.

## 6. Poetic Glossary of Meaning

**Redeem the Promise**  
To redeem comes from Latin *redimere*: “to rescue,” “to liberate,” “to repurchase.” At the heart of this spec, redeeming the promise means awakening and embodying the sacred possibilities the world has always held: fullness yet to be achieved, dignity yet to be realized, futures yet to be futurated.

Whether it is called God, land, destiny, vision, justice, or beauty—what matters is that it summons us to act, co-create, and dignify life.  
Redeeming the promise lies at the mystical heart of this Spec.
