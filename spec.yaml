foresight:
  orientation: >
    My practice of foresight is grounded in discernment that inhabits the
    future through aesthetic desire, embodied ethics, and symbolic thought.
    I read the signs of the times to find the meeting point between my vision
    and the collective resonance so they can transform one another.

  principles:
    - name: "I AM – Foresight Creed"
      text: >
        I AM a living presence that meets the world not to demand what I lack,
        but to offer what I am. My foresight is service: I read and honor the
        present, I contribute in humble dialogue, and I act with the dignity of
        one who knows the Divine also manifests through me. I walk without
        nostalgia or victimhood, with the certainty that my consciousness is
        unique and that every encounter is sacred.
    - name: "Stewardship of Nostalgia"
      text: >
        I acknowledge nostalgia as a reservoir of meaning—beauty lived, love
        received—but I refuse its gravitational pull. I harvest its symbols,
        thank the past, and convert that energy into lucid presence and
        forward motion.

  method:
    fieldwork:
      - "Pattern reading: narratives, symbols, macro signals."
      - "Dialogic probes: short cycles to test resonance with stakeholders."
      - "Small-bet sprints: measurable moves in 2–4 weeks."
    practice_rules:
      - "Listen first. Name clearly. Propose minimally-sufficient action."
      - "Design for shared gains; avoid zero-sum framings."
      - "Measure outcomes early; adapt with dignity."

micro_playbook:
  pre_meeting_cue: "I am here to offer value. I listen first. I speak clearly. I propose creation."
  openers:
    - "Here’s a quick read of your context and a 30-day move we can test."
    - "I’m here to co-design a result, not deliver a monologue."
  frame:
    present_read: "One crisp insight about their situation."
    leverage_point: "Smallest intervention with outsized impact."
    offer: "What I do in 2 weeks to de-risk."
    ask: "The one thing I need from them."
